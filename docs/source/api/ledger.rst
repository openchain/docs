Ledger structure
================

At the core, an Openchain ledger is a key-value store, represented by :ref:`records <data-structures-records>`. At the data store level, record keys can be any arbitrary byte string. However, Openchain Ledger expects a well defined structure for the record keys.

Record keys
-----------

Record keys are UTF8-encoded strings. They are structured in three parts, separated by colons (``:``).

1. **The record path**: A path in the :ref:`account hierarchy <account-hierarchy>` indicating where the record is situated.
2. **The record type**: A value indicating the :ref:`type <record-types>` of the record.
3. **The record name**: The name of the record.

The combination of these three values uniquely identify a record.

Example 1
~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    /p2pkh/mfiCwNxuFYMtb5ytCacgzDAineD2GNCnYo/:ACC:/asset/p2pkh/n15g8F3sVLufwvPmmX7tYPWrGGbGSbcaEB/

The path is ``/p2pkh/mfiCwNxuFYMtb5ytCacgzDAineD2GNCnYo/``, the record type is ``ACC`` and the record name is ``/asset/p2pkh/n15g8F3sVLufwvPmmX7tYPWrGGbGSbcaEB/``.
    
Example 2
~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    /:DATA:info

The path is ``/`` (root path), the record type is ``DATA`` and the record name is ``info``.
    
.. _account-hierarchy:

Account hierarchy
-----------------

Openchain uses a hierarchy of accounts, similar to a file system. This adds a lot of interesting management options that systems like Bitcoin don't have.

Accounts are identified by a path.

Account paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The syntax for an account path follows a number of rules:

* Account paths start with the character ``/``.
* Account paths end with the character ``/``.
* Sections of an account path are separated by the character ``/``.
* Sections of an account path may only contain alphanumeric characters and characters from the following set: ``$-_.+!*'(),``.

.. _record-types:

Record types
------------

There are two valid record types as of this version of Openchain.

``ACC`` record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ACC`` record is used for representing a balance for a given asset type. The name of the record must be a path that represents the asset type. The value must be a 64-bits signed integer encoded in big endian. The value represents the current balance for the given account and the given asset type.

.. _data-record:

``DATA`` record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DATA`` record is used to store arbitrary text data. The record name can be any valid UTF-8 string. It can be used to store things such as :ref:`asset metadata <asset-metadata>`, :ref:`symbolic links <goto-records>` within the accounting system, :ref:`permissions <dynamic-permissions>`, or any other important piece of arbitrary data that needs to be cryptographically secure.
